# liftoff-capstone
This is a capstone project created for LaunchCode's Liftoff program. The idea behind this program is pretty simple - 
do you have a collection of items, and accidentally purchased the same thing twice? In this case I collect classic
video games, and have more than once bought the same game. Enter this project.

Here, users will be able to create a inventory of games they own for each console they have. Each user will have their
own list of games, and this list can be added to and removed from as they wish. Eventually, the web front end should be 
able to be exposed to the internet with the intention of viewing it from mobile devices, allowing users to login and 
view their games remotely. 

After the MVP is created further improvements may be made such as including new 'categories' of items, not just games,
and seeking the ability to scrape data from web sources on each item, such as boxart and details, or linking to wikipedia.
